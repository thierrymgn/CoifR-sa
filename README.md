# School Project: Hair Salon Reservation System

This repository contains our school project, where we had several topics to choose from and we decided to go with the first one: "Hair Salon Reservation System".

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to create a reservation solution for hair salons, similar to Planity. The system is designed to cater to three types of users:

1. **Hair Salons**: They can provide their opening slots (for each salon and hairdresser).
2. **Clients**: After logging in, clients can reserve a slot.
3. **Administrators**: They have the ability to manage the system.

## Getting Started

1. copy .env.example to your own .env
2. run `docker-compose up` to start the project
